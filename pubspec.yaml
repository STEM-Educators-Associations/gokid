  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/images/
    - assets/images/kids/
    - assets/images/bg/
    - assets/images/ic/

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/resolution-aware-images

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/asset-from-package

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Mulish
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/Mulish/Mulish-Regular.ttf
        - asset: assets/Mulish/Mulish-Bold.ttf
        - asset: assets/Mulish/Mulish-Italic.ttf
        - asset: assets/Mulish/Mulish-BoldItalic.ttf
        - asset: assets/Mulish/Mulish-Black.ttf
